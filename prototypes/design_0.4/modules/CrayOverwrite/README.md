  * ``core/cpe``: Not used in the prototype but just an example of what the
    corresponding Cray PE module should be like.

  * ``core/cpe-generic``: The overwrite modules for our purpose.

  * ``data-cpe``: Files that are only needed on those systems that lack the cpe
    modules, currently just there to be able to test on the Grenoble system.
